## Issue
There are a plethora of habit or goal related apps, However
a lot of these applications that are designed to be used on one's computer, most
other habit related apps or designed to be run on a mobile device.
While there are a lot of advantages to running such an application on the phone,
this solution doesn't fit everyone. ScheduleMe aims to make it easy for users
who do not wish to track goals or habits on their phone to do so on their 
computer.

## Previous works

## Assumptions
ScheduleMe is designed as a standalone computer program.

## Functionality
ScheduleMe allows users to input a goal that they wish to accomplish. Users are
able to set a name, description, category, and depending on whether the goal is 
marked as indefinite or definite: a frequency or due date respectively. The user 
also has access to some predefined activity types as well. Users 
are able to view all of their currently in progress goals as well as any goal
that completed. Users are able to edit or delete the goal as necessary. ScheduleMe
also incorporates an achievement system as an incentive to motivate the user.

### Operations:
- Add goal: The user is able to create a goal with custom name, description,
category, activity, time interval, due date or frequency depending on the 
time interval set
- 2
- 3
- 4

## Solution
Since ScheduleMe is designed to be used on the computer, it gives users a 
lot more power and flexibility when it comes to their goals. If a user has 
a very intricate goal with lots of details, it is much simpler to input these
criteria into a computer app compared to a mobile app. Additionally, our program
makes it easy to retrieve to the CSV files associated with the goals if the user
wishes to plot these metrics or otherwise store them.
